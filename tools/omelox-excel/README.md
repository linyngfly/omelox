## Omelox -- a fast, scalable game server framework for node.js

Omelox is a fast, scalable game server framework for [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
It provides the basic development framework and many related components, including libraries and tools.
Omelox is also suitable for real-time web applications; its distributed architecture makes omelox scale better than other real-time web frameworks.

## Features

### Complete support of game server and realtime application server architecture

* Multiple-player game: mobile, social, web, MMO rpg(middle size)
* Realtime application: chat,  message push, etc.

### Fast, scalable

* Distributed (multi-process) architecture, can be easily scale up
* Flexible server extension
* Full performance optimization and test

### Easy

* Simple API: request, response, broadcast, etc.
* Lightweight: high development efficiency based on node.js
* Convention over configuration: almost zero config

### Powerful

* Many clients support, including javascript, flash, android, iOS, cocos2d-x, C
* Many libraries and tools, including command line tool, admin tool, performance test tool, AI, path finding etc.
* Good reference materials: full docs, many examples and [an open-source MMO RPG demo](https://github.com/NetEase/omelox/wiki/Introduction-to--Lord-of-Omelox)

### Extensible

* Support plugin architecture, easy to add new features through plugins. We also provide many plugins like online status, master high availability.
* Custom features, users can define their own network protocol, custom components very easy.

## Why should I use omelox?
Fast, scalable, real-time game server development is not an easy job, and a good container or framework can reduce its complexity.
Unfortunately, unlike web, finding a game server framework solution is difficult, especially an open source solution. Omelox fills this gap, providing a full solution for building game server frameworks.
